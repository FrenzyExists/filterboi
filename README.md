### A stupid simple median filter written in scala.

I Made this for a homework on the course Programming Languages. Students had to implement the median filter algorithm using scala. Now... why Scala? Simple, Scala is a concurrent language, and for the assignment, we student were to experiment with threads. T

his is pretty much my first time messing with threads so, kinda exited I got this lil trinket into work

At the moment the median filter is not fully implemented, only the algorithm itself. I still haven't done the image parser thingy with the Salt-Pepper filter using OpenCV. 

Expect another update soon :D
