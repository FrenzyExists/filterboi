### A stupid simple median filter written in scala.

I Made this for a homework on the course Programming Languages. Students had to implement the median filter algorithm using scala. Now... why Scala? Simple, Scala is a concurrent language, and for the assignment, we student were to experiment with threads. 

This is pretty much my first time messing with threads so, kinda exited I got this lil trinket into work
